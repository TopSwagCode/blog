Well never been good at telling about my self. I will try my best to give you the best insight to who I am and where I came from. I am a 31 year old software developer who has been through alot.
I have traveled many roads literally and figuratively.
Well it first really started when I completed primary school.
My first major decision, one of many to come.

I had to pick a school to go to next. I had allways been into computers, so ofcourse I picked business college :P
I could have picked tech college, but the course they both offered had alot in common, like lots of math. Tech college did have physics which I missed out on. The main reason at the time was that I was really shy and never really talked to any girls at the age of 15-16. The business school in my city at the time had like 4-6 guys per class and 15-17 girls. So I knew I would be forced to learn to speak with the opposite sex.

Half way through this education I was diagnosed with an unknown kidney disease. 
At the time my kidney function was at ~ 33%. The doctors gave me some medication to slow the process.
Sadly they could not do anything to stop it. So I continued in school and visited the hospital in one of the bigger cities every second week for checkups. My class and teachers was super supportive. I completed it with decent grades.

Then came my second major decision. Where to go next? Not only did I had to decide if I wanted to start working or I would continue to study. But if I wanted to continue study I would have to move to one of the major cities in Denmark, cause there was no higher education where my family lived. I had during my business school started learning my self programming and made a couple of different websites for friends and people I had talked to online. So I started studying Arts.

Just kiding. I moved to Aarhus to start studying computer science at the university. 
A year into my studies my kidneys took their final blow and I went into a koma for 2 days.
I remember one evening I had a nose bleed that woudn't stop so I went to normal night doctor.
He gave me something that looked like a tampon up my nose to make it stop.
But when I came home it just moved over to my other nosepit. So I went back.
When I was sitting in is office chair waiting for him to come back in I remember seeing him come in the door 
when I was slowly failing down the chair. It all went black. I never felt hitting the ground.

I woke up 2 days later with my family around me with tube in my throat and medical equipment all over my body.
At first I could not remember anything that had happened. It was first 1 month after the episode I really realised
what really had happend and I had lost 2 days of my life like it had never happened. I was in the hospital for 3 months straight. I started dialisis that required me to go to the hospital for several hours every second day to clean my blood. I quickly got used to the machine and was taught how to use it. This enabled me to join the night shift for people who could setup dialises for them self and did not need alot of nurses and doctors to help them. This was only a small group of people that had day jobs and other things to attend during the day. This enabled me to go back to school.

I still really wanted to go back to study computer science at the university, but I was afraid to aim to high.
I started with studying AP program in Software Development and during my studies I got a internship at danish company Novicell, that was understanding about my medical needs. When I was gratuated they offered me a job. 
Then something even more amazing happend. Only a few days after I gratuated I was offered a new kidney! I couldn't have planed it better if I tried.

Even though this amazing thing had happened to me I went into a bad depression. I had gone from having no spare time, because of fulltime study, internship and hospital. To having all the time in the world. I wasn't allowed to work the firt 3 month, because they had to get my medication right and I had to recover from the surgery.

I started working fulltime at Novicell and loved it :) I really learned alot from being out there. Working with alot of skilled developers and awesome managment. I am truly gratefull for the time I spent there. During the 2 years I worked there I also found the love of my life <3 A old childhood friend from my hometown. We somehow ended up chatting again and ended up me visiting her. Which lead to more visists and ended up moving together.

I ended up quiting my job for going back to study. The plan was never to stop with an AP program in Computer Science. It was simply to start small and go from there. I went back to school and finished my Bachelor in Software development. During which I was so lucky getting an internship at Ebay Denmark. I also made my Bachelor Assignment with Ebay in focus. When I finished I wanted to try something completely different than Novicell, to see what other sides of software development had to offer. I eneded up applying for a job at the company that owned the building Ebay was renting a part of. Stibo System's. A major player in Master Data Managment, that nobody has heard of :D 

They were looking for a QA Engineer with 10 years of experience and a Master in computer science and bla bla bla bla. I didn't really care and gave it a shot. I really didn't think I would ever had a chance of getting the job. Only experience I had in the field, was a course I took during my bachelors with 4 other students. All the other students took Advaned Web Development, which made no sense for me, since I allready had worked some years at Novicell and knew that most of the part the course had to offer. 

I remembering coming late for my first interview. I made a rookie mistake and showed up at Stibo System's headquaters, while the invitation was at a recruitment office. I called in telling them I was sorry and I was at Stibo. They laughed and said I could just come later that day. So I called a cab and went straight down there and waited. I was invited for a second interview, this time at Stibo meeting the people who was going to hire me. I had allready done alot of research about how they were working and what tools they were using. So I made an advanced demo showcasing alot of features that Selenium had to offer and prepared for all kind of questions they might have. I brought my laptop to the interview, so I could show them the demo if needed.

The interview started with a small talk. Then came the tech question. They pushed a couple of peaces of paper to me with some sample code. I started to chuckle abit. I explained all the code without any problems and told them I more or less had build the same code and alot more to show my understanding of their tech stack. Stibo was working with Java and I had mainly only worked with C# and some Javascript before.

It ended up with them offering me the job. I joined the small group of 7 QA engineers with different backgrounds. I was the first QA Engineer with software developer background. I quickly adopted the new way of working and helped stibo increasing quality of their Test Code Base. Helping introducing Design Patterns for QA team and introducing jMeter for performance testing. Some time I also felt it helped me alot having a developer background letting me comunicate better with the ~ 40 developers in house at the time.

Time went by Stibo paid for the first part of my Master in computer science. Where I got my eyes up for Docker and Cloud computing. My urge for backend programming had sparked. I was contacted by a recruitment company about what sounded like my dream job. Working with all the new sparkling stuff. Working with Test Driven Development and all the buzz. I quit my job at Stibo and started working at Wallmob. Shortly after starting I saw it was a death match. The 2 lead developers told us they were going to quit the first chance they had and the company was bleeding money. I started having panic attacks cause I had quit a good job for the chance of my dream job.

With the support of my girlfriend I quit my job with no new job in sight. This was one of the best decisions in my life. I more or less applied for any software developer jobs that I could find. Even at this company called First Agenda prior eDagsorden. I had heard abit about them before and didn't really want to work there. I had heard they worked on old public sector agenda systems. But I need the money and a steady job without stress. When I came to the interview I met passionate developers like my self actual working with the tech I wanted to work with. Yes they had some legacy system, but they also was working on building new and awesome software. This was the job I was looking for all along. Now I am working with the tech stack I love. With like minded developers.

All this time I have used alot of my spare time going to different code events and meetups. I even won a Startup event in Aarhus with the "Nu App", with a group of like minded people building a Social Media App for meeting new people in the town you live in.

Another passion of mine is table top games. When my girlfriend and I moved to Horsens, we didn't know any people. So we started our own board game group on facebook and let anyone signup who wanted to come by and and play some games. We me many new and wonderfull people and some we still meet up with even tough we moved away from Horsens again. 

I spend time with my lovely girlfriend and enjoying the quit life in Gedved with her, our 2 cats and dog :)
