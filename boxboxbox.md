This is a small 3D Endless Runner game. Built with unity using only boxes. Therefore the name "Box Box Box". It has been a fun learning project, that I like to visit from time to time, adding new features or just playing it :D 

Roadmap for the game:

* Making the game opensource on Github.
* CI/CD Github actions pipelines.
* Adding more sections to the game.
* Making progressive level hardness the further players go.
* Leader boards.
* Skins / Customization.
* Whatever more I can think of in the future :D
